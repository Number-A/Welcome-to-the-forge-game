Welcome to the forge is a game made int he context of one of my classes (Intro to Game Dev. (Comp 376) at Concordia University)

This project was the final project. We were a team of 6 people. 

My personal contribution was on the UI of the game. This includes the Main Menu and its sub menues, the Crafting menu, the Inventory, the UI seen during gameplay and all of their functionalities and integration with the game.
